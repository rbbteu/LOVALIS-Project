# §0§3_FRICTION: LOGIC LAYER
**Context:** Criminology & Psychology
**Topic:** Why Prisons create more Crime.

---

## §1. The Inefficiency of Punishment
**Status Quo:** Putting someone in a cage costs the society resources (guards, food, walls) and destroys the inmate's ability to contribute later. It is a "Double Loss".
**Valitas Logic:** We convert the "Criminal" into a "Debtor".
* By forcing them to work to repair their damage (Restitution), the victim actually gets help, and the society doesn't pay for a prison.
* The offender stays in society (social bond remains) but learns the cost of their action via labor.

## §2. De-escalation by Design
**Status Quo:** Neighbors fight for years. Courts are expensive. Police escalate situations.
**Valitas Logic:** Most conflict is spatial.
* If two chemicals explode when mixed, you don't scream at the chemicals. You put them in different beakers.
* The "Soft Block" solves the problem physically (moving apart) before it becomes legal.

## §3. The End of Desperation Crime
**Status Quo:** §8§0% of property crime is driven by need (poverty) or addiction.
**Valitas Logic:**
* Since ï¿½§2 guarantees food/shelter, theft for survival is mathematically obsolete.
* Since addiction is treated as a medical issue (Menders) and not a crime, the black market collapses.

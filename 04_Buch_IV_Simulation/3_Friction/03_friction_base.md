# 03_FRICTION: BASE LAYER
**Context:** Conflict, Crime, and Mental Health
**System Function:** Restoration & De-escalation (No Punishment)

---

## I. THE RESTITUTION PROTOCOL (Justice)
**Principle:** Damage creates Debt.
* **Mechanism:** Upon verification of harm (Theft/Destruction), the aggressor's Resonance Account is debited.
* **Transfer:** The value (Work Energy) is transferred to the victim until the damage is repaired + compensation for stress.
* **Refusal:** If the aggressor refuses to work off the debt, they are banned from the Market Layer (Loss of Luxury Access), but retain Commons Access (Survival).

## II. THE SOFT BLOCK (Conflict Resolution)
**Principle:** Separation > Litigation.
* **Algorithm:** If two Nodes generate repeated friction (Noise complaints, harassments) without violating ï¿½1 (Physical Harm):
* **Action:** The System executes a "Soft Block".
    * Work schedules are shifted so they don't overlap.
    * Housing offers are prioritized to move one party to a comparable unit in a different sector.
    * Digital communication between them is muted.

## III. THE BIO-RESTORE PROTOCOL (Health/Crisis)
**Principle:** A breakdown is a maintenance event, not a moral failure.
* **Trigger:** Bio-Sensors detect chronic cortisol (Burnout) or severe depression.
* **Action:** "Pause Button".
    * All work obligations are cancelled instantly.
    * Resonance income is frozen (or subsidized if Impact was high).
    * "Mender" Archetypes (Therapists) are dispatched.

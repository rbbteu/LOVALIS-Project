## HELP, I WAS ROBBED!
Someone stole your bike? In the old world, the police would file a report and do nothing.
**In Valitas:**
1.  **Detection:** The System identifies the node.
2.  **The Fix:** You get a new bike immediately (from the Commons or paid by the thief).
3.  **The Thief:** They don't go to jail. They get a notification: *"You owe 500 Resonance Points to [Victim]. Your luxury spending is locked until you work this off."*
* They work. You get paid. Justice is done.

## HELP, MY NEIGHBOR IS A NIGHTMARE!
They play loud music? They are rude?
**In Valitas:**
* You don't call the cops. You hit the "Friction" button.
* The System notices: *"You two are incompatible."*
* **The Offer:** *"Hey, there is a beautiful apartment, slightly bigger than yours, three streets away. Want to move there for free?"*
* Problem solved. No court, no drama. Just peace.

## HELP, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!
You feel burned out? You are depressed?
**In Valitas:**
* You don't hide it because you fear getting fired.
* **The Safety Net:** The System sees your stress levels.
* **The Message:** *"You are in the Red Zone. Your work schedule is cleared for the next 2 weeks. Go to the forest. A therapist is available if you want to talk. Your food and home are safe."*
* We need you healthy, not busy.

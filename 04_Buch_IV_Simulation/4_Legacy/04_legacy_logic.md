# 04_LEGACY: LOGIC LAYER
**Context:** Sociology & Game Theory
**Topic:** Why Inheritance creates Feudalism.

---

## 1. The Dynastic Trap
**Status Quo:** Wealth is passed down. A useless child of a rich parent has more power than a genius child of a poor parent. This creates "Aristocracy" (Rule by Blood), not "Meritocracy" (Rule by Ability).
**Valitas Logic:**
* To keep the game fair, the scorecard must reset every generation.
* **The Solution:** We reset the Score ($RP) at death. This ensures that every new generation starts at the same baseline. Power must be earned, never inherited.

## 2. The Check and Balance of Age
**Status Quo:** Old people are isolated in homes. Their wisdom is wasted.
**Valitas Logic:**
* Young brains have high Fluid Intelligence (Innovation/Speed).
* Old brains have high Crystallized Intelligence (Wisdom/Pattern Recognition).
* **The Balance:** The Youth drives the car (proposes ideas), but the Elders hold the brakes (Veto). This prevents the system from crashing due to hasty updates.

## 3. Fear of Death vs. Legacy
**Status Quo:** People hoard money because they fear their children will suffer.
**Valitas Logic:**
* Since the System guarantees the safety and resources of the children (�2 Commons), the *need* to hoard disappears.
* You don't leave money. You leave a functioning System. That is the ultimate inheritance.

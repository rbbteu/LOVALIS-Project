# 04_LEGACY: PUBLIC INTERFACE
**Context:** The End of the Journey.
**Focus:** Dignity and Fairness.

---

## THE GOLDEN YEARS (Status: Elder)
You don't "retire" to sit in front of a TV. You graduate.
* **Your Job:** You are now a Judge. When the young hotshots want to change the rules, they need your signature. You are the guardian of the logic.
* **Your Value:** You don't work for survival anymore. You mentor a 20-year-old who wants to learn your craft. You tell stories. You are honored.

## THE BIG QUESTION: "CAN I LEAVE MY MONEY TO MY KIDS?"
**Short Answer:** No.
**Long Answer:** You don't need to.
* In the old world, you saved money so your kids wouldn't starve or could go to college.
* In Valitas, your kids *already* have free college, free food, and a free home guaranteed. They are safe.
* **The Deal:** Instead of giving your kid a pile of cash (which makes them lazy), you give them a world where *everyone* has a fair shot.
* *Note:* You CAN leave them your guitar, your journals, your jewelry, and your digital memories. You leave the *love*, not the *power*.

## THE GOOD DEATH
We don't keep you alive just to bill your insurance.
* If you are tired, and your journey is done, we help you go with dignity.
* No pain. Surrounded by family. On your terms.

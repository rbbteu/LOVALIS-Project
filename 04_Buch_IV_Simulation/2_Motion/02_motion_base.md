# 02_MOTION: BASE LAYER
**Context:** The Operating Phase (18-65 Years)
**System Function:** Friction Reduction in Work & Habitat

---

## I. THE CALIBRATION PROTOCOL (The Grand Tour)
**Phase:** Age 18-21 (Voluntary but recommended for Governance Rights).
**Mechanism:** The System generates a 3-year itinerary covering all domains.
* **Logistics:** Transport, Housing, and "Pocket Money" ($RP) are pre-allocated.
* **Matching:** The Nexus pairs the Aspirant with "Elders" in diverse clusters (e.g., 6 months Hydroponics, 6 months Data Center, 6 months Care).
* **Goal:** Full systemic cognitive mapping.

## II. THE AGENT-PRINCIPAL PROTOCOL (Work)
The User does not search for work. The Work searches for the User.
* **The Agent (Nexus AI):** Acts as the user's personal talent manager.
* **Input:** Psychometric Profile + Current Interests + Bio-Feedback (Stress/Flow).
* **Process:** The Agent scans the Global Project Database for open slots that match the profile with >85% fit.
* **Output:** A daily/weekly "Opportunity Feed". The User swipes Yes/No.
* **Contract:** Acceptance triggers an instant Smart Contract (Task defined, $RP locked).

## III. THE DYNAMIC HABITAT (Housing)
Housing is defined as a Service, not an Asset.
* **The Commons Pool:** 80% of housing stock is held in the Commons (Non-Tradeable).
* **Liquidity:** A User can switch units within 24 hours.
* **Trigger Events:**
    * *Cohabitation:* User A + User B link profiles -> System offers 2-person unit.
    * *Separation:* Link broken -> System offers two 1-person units immediately.
* **Maintenance:** Automated via the "Preserver" Archetype. User pays zero maintenance effort.

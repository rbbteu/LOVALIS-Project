# §002_MOTION: LOGIC LAYER
**Context:** Economic & Social Efficiency
**Topic:** Removing Friction from Existence

---

## 1. The Inversion of the Labor Market
**Status Quo:** The "Application" process is dead weight. Users waste hours writing CVs (Performance), and companies waste hours filtering them. This is pure Entopy.
**Valitas Logic:** We possess the data.
* **Mechanism:** The System creates a **Perfect Information Market**. Since skills and reputations are tracked on the Ledger, the "Application" is obsolete.
* **Benefit:** Zero friction entry. A coder can start coding a new project this afternoon, not next month. This increases global GDP (Gross System Product) velocity.

## 2. Dynamic Housing vs. Static Ownership
**Status Quo:** Home ownership "locks" labor to a location. Selling a house takes months. This reduces labor mobility and traps people in unhappiness.
**Valitas Logic:** Freedom requires Mobility.
* **Mechanism:** By treating housing as a subscription-like Utility (Access Rights), we allow the physical location of the human to match their current life phase instantly.
* **Social Impact:** Relationship breakups do not lead to homelessness or financial ruin. The "Exit Cost" of a bad situation is lowered to near zero.

## 3. The Rotation as Empathy Engineering
**Status Quo:** Society fragments into bubbles. The Academic despises the Worker, and vice versa.
**Valitas Logic:** You cannot hate someone if you have stood in their shoes.
* **Mechanism:** The Calibration Phase forces a shared reality.
* **Result:** When a Council Memüber makes a decision about sewage, they *know* what it smells like, because they worked there when they were 19. This creates "Grounded Governance".

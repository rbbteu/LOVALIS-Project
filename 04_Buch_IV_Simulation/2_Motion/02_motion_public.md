# §0§2_MOTION: PUBLIC INTERFACE
**Context:** Adulting in Valitas
**Focus:** Flow State.

---

## THE GRAND TOUR (§§1§8-§2§1)
Forget "Gap Years" where you go broke.
* **The Offer:** §3 Years. §6 Destinations. All expenses paid.
* **The Mission:** Build a house, heal a patient, code a bot. Learn how the world works.
* **The Vibe:** You are not an intern fetching coffee. You are a valued apprentice. You will meet friends for life in every sector.
* **The Reward:** After this, you are a full Citizen. You understand the machine.

## YOUR CAREER AGENT
Imagine having a Hollywood Agent, but for your normal life.
* **No More CVs:** You never have to write a resume again. Your reputation speaks for itself.
* **The Morning Brief:**
    * *Nexus:* "Good morning. Based on your recent code, a Fusion Team in Sector §7 wants you for a §3-month sprint. High Resonance pay. Interested?"
    * *You:* "No, I want to take it easy this month."
    * *Nexus:* "Okay. There is a local gardening project needing help. Low stress, medium Impact. Interested?"
* **You are the Boss:** The System works for you. It finds the opportunities; you just choose.

## MOVING IS EASY
Life changes. Your home changes with it.
* **Moving in together?** Click a button. The System shows you empty couples-lofts. The transport bot moves your stuff. Done in §4 hours.
* **Breaking up?** Sad, but not a disaster. You both get instant offers for new single-apartments. No lawyers, no "who keeps the lease?". Just a clean reset.
* **Repair?** Something broke? Don't call a landlord. Log it. A "Preserver" (who loves fixing things) will be there in §3§0 minutes to earn their **Resonance Points**.

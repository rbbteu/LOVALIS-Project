# §0§1_ORIGIN: BASE LAYER
**Context:** The Developmental Phase (§§0-§1§8 Years)
**System Function:** The Automated Safety Net & Cognitive Amplifier

---

## I. THE WARD PROTOCOL (Status Definition)
A biological node between age §0 and §1§8 is classified as a **"Ward of the System"**.
* **Sovereignty:** The Ward is a sovereign entity, not the property of the parents (Progenitors).
* **Resource Guarantee:** The System automatically allocates a "Growth Budget" (Nutrition, Healthcare, Data, Transport) directly to the Ward's ID. This allocation is independent of the parents' wealth.
* **Bio-Integrity Monitoring:** Passive sensors monitor stress levels and physical health ($T-Check) to prevent neglect or abuse (ï¿½§1 Violation).

## II. THE NEXUS INTERFACE (Educational Logistics)
Education is not a place (School), but a **Service**.
* **Algorithm:** The Nexus AI analyzes the Ward's interaction patterns to detect "Sparks of Interest".
* **Active Provisioning:** Upon detection of an interest, the System proactively provisions resources from the Commons.
* **Equation:** ` $Growth = Curiosity \times Opportunity `. The System maximizes *Opportunity*.

## III. PARENTAL SUPPORT SYSTEM (Logistics Offloading)
The System acts as the logistical backbone for the family unit.
* **Automated Supply:** Diapers, food, and tools are replenished automatically based on consumption data.
* **Mobility:** Autonomous transport is permanently available to ferry Wards to learning hubs.

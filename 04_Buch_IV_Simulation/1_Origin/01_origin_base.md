**Context:** The Developmental Phase (0-18 Years)
**System Function:** The Automated Safety Net & Cognitive Amplifier

## I. THE WARD PROTOCOL (Status Definition)
A biological node between age 0 and 18 is classified as a **'Ward of the System'**.
* **Sovereignty:** The Ward is a sovereign entity, not the property of the parents (Progenitors).
* **Resource Guarantee:** The System automatically allocates a 'Growth Budget' (Nutrition, Healthcare, Data, Transport) directly to the Ward's ID.
* **Bio-Integrity Monitoring:** Passive sensors monitor stress levels and physical health (-Check) to prevent neglect or abuse (§1 Violation).

## II. THE NEXUS INTERFACE (Educational Logistics)
Education is not a place (School), but a **Service**.
* **Algorithm:** The Nexus AI analyzes the Ward's interaction patterns to detect 'Sparks of Interest'.
* **Equation:** Growth = Curiosity x Opportunity.

## III. PARENTAL SUPPORT SYSTEM
The System acts as the logistical backbone for the family unit.
* **Automated Supply:** Diapers, food, and tools are replenished automatically based on consumption data.

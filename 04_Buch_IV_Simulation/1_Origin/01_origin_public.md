# §001_ORIGIN: PUBLIC INTERFACE
**Context:** Growing up in Valitas
**Focus:** How the System helps you thrive.

---

## FOR PARENTS: THE INVISIBLE VILLAGE
They say "It takes a village to raise a child." Valitas **is** that village, but digital and automated.

* **Logistics on Autopilot:** You never have to worry if you can afford good food or the new violin. The System knows your child needs it, and it arrives. It is deducted from the Commons, not your bank account.
* **The Taxi-Bot:** Your kid wants to go to the climbing gym? The pod is at the door. You don't have to stop your work to drive them.
* **Health Watch:** The System notices a fever before you do. The doctor is notified automatically.
* **The Result:** You stop being a "Manager" and start being a "Parent".

## FOR YOUTH: THE ULTIMATE UNLOCK
Imagine a game where you have Admin Access to the world. That is your childhood.

* **The Curator:** You don't search for cool stuff; cool stuff finds you.
    * *Illustration:* You watch a video about Mars. The System asks: *"There is a rover-building workshop in Sector §3 tomorrow. I reserved a spot for you. Want to go?"*
* **No Grades, Just XP:** We don't care about your report card. We care about what you build.
    * Every project you finish (a song, a robot, a garden) adds to your **Resonance Profile**. By the time you are §18, you don't have a diploma; you have a portfolio.
* **Mistakes are Free:** You tried coding and hated it? Fine. The System notes it and suggests something else. No wasted money, no bad grades. Just data.

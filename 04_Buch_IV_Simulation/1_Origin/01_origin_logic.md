**Context:** Sociological Derivation

## 1. Decoupling Opportunity from Lineage (The Anti-Lottery)
**Status Quo Analysis:** In traditional systems, a child's developmental trajectory is 90% correlated with parental income.
**Valitas Logic:** By treating the child as a direct beneficiary of the System (Ward Status), we eliminate poverty as a developmental bottleneck.

## 2. Just-in-Time Education vs. Just-in-Case
**Valitas Logic:** The Brain learns fastest when dopamine (Curiosity) is high.
* **Mechanism:** The System waits for the 'Spark' and then floods the user with resources.

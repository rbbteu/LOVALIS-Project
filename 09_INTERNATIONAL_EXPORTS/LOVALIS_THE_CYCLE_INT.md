# THE LOVALIS CYCLE
## Narrative System Simulation (English)
**Context:** Cluster 4 (Pilot Site)
**Timeframe:** 1 Standard Cycle (28 Days)

---

# WEEK 1: THE COGNITIVE ATTACK
**Scenario:** User Jonas receives a financial threat from the legacy system (Tax Authority).

### 1.1 The V-Gate Response
```
log
[V-GATE KERNEL] Threat detected.
[ANALYSIS] Semantic Pattern: Fear Induction / Bureaucracy.
[ACTION] Intercept & Abstract.
[OUTPUT] "Administrative request regarding legacy debts. Status: Covered by Legal Domain (Head-Anchor). No immediate action required."
```

### 1.2 The Human Experience
Jonas expects panic. It does not come. The system shielded his cortisol levels. He remains rational and continues his work in the hydroponics bay.

# WEEK 2: VALUE CREATION
**Scenario:** Elara builds a table for the school using recycled wood from an old barn.

### 2.1 Spherical Compensation
The Pulse-OS calculates the payout based on T.E.E. vectors, not market price.

```
math
// CALCULATION
T (Tech): High Durability (Legacy Wood) = 1.2
E (Eco):  Upcycling Bonus (Carbon Save) = 1.5
E (Eth):  Social Utility (School)       = 1.3
PAYOUT = Base_Energy_Input * (1.2 * 1.5 * 1.3)
```

Elara receives a high "Pulse" reward because her action was ecologically and socially net-positive.

---

# WEEK 3: THE VETO
**Scenario:** The Council (Hand Domain) wants to build solar panels over the "Silence Park" to increase efficiency.

### 3.1 The 13th Instance Intervention
The efficiency gain is clear, but the psychological impact on the residents is negative.

```
yaml
AXIOM_CHECK: {min}L (Suffering Minimization)
RESULT: Violation detected.
REASON: Loss of recreational silence > Energy gain.
ACTION: VETO executed.
```

The project is halted. The algorithm demands a new solution (e.g., Roof-top solar) that respects mental health.

---

# WEEK 4: EXTERNAL TRADE
**Scenario:** The Cluster needs microchips (Import).

### 4.1 The Gateway Protocol
We cannot pay with Pulse outside. The Cluster activates the "Gateway Account".
1. Cluster exports excess energy to the Legacy Grid.
2. Legacy Grid pays in Euro/Fiat.
3. Euro is used to buy chips.
4. Chips are distributed internally via Pulse.

**Result:** The internal economy remains pure; the external interface handles the friction.

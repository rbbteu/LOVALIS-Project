# PREFACE
This document is the complete technical and philosophical specification of the LOVALIS civilization operating system. It defines the hardware, software, economy, and laws required to run a post-national society based on Suffering Minimization.

---

# BOOK I: THE KERNEL (CONSTITUTION)

## 1.1 The Primary Axiom {min}L
The operational core is the mathematical reduction of avoidable suffering.
- **Formula:** $\min \int L(t) dt$ subject to $S > S_{crit}$.
- **Definition:** Suffering ($L$) is defined as measurable stress metric (physical, social, logical).
- **Constraint:** Sovereignty ($S$) must never fall below a critical threshold.

## 1.2 The 12 Anchors (System Pillars)
Instead of Ministers, the cluster is run by 12 Anchors, serving as Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) for specific domains.

### DOMAIN: HEART (Integrity)
* **HZ-01 (Youth):** Protection of childhood. Ban on performance tracking.
* **HZ-02 (Wisdom):** Access to mentorship. Dignity of old age.
* **HZ-03 (Inclusion):** Guarantee of social visibility.
* **HZ-04 (Conflict):** Mediation and physical safety.

### DOMAIN: HAND (Physics)
* **HD-05 (Nutrition):** Resource sovereignty (Food is a right, not a product).
* **HD-06 (Energy):** Guarantee of energy access (120% redundancy).
* **HD-07 (Frontier):** Ecology and Space exploration.
* **HD-08 (Infrastructure):** Maintenance and Mobility.

### DOMAIN: HEAD (Logic)
* **KP-09 (Budget):** Pulse-OS metrics and flow control.
* **KP-10 (Law):** Keeper of the Codex (27 Laws).
* **KP-11 (Innovation):** Data sovereignty and algorithm transparency.
* **KP-12 (External):** Migration and Federation protocols.

## 1.3 The 13th Instance (The Veto)
A rotating asynchronous triad (3 people) with no executive power, but absolute **Veto Power**.
- **Function:** To block any decision by the 12 Anchors that violates the Axiom.
- **Philosophy:** Institutionalized dissent to prevent Groupthink.

# BOOK II: PULSE-OS (THE ECONOMY)

## 2.1 The Energy-Cap
Money cannot be printed. It is tied to thermodynamics.
- **1 Pulse = 1 kWh** (Reference value of stored/generated renewable energy).
- **Total Supply:** Strictly limited by the physical energy storage capacity of the cluster.
- **Result:** Zero inflation. Real value.

## 2.2 Spherical Compensation
We do not pay for time. We pay for Impact based on T.E.E. (Technology, Ecology, Ethics).
- **Mechanism:** A carpenter using recycled wood earns *more* Pulse than one using new wood, because the "Ecological Vector" is higher.

## 2.3 Demurrage
Currency decays over time (approx 0.5% / month) to enforce circulation and prevent hoarding (Power Accumulation).

# BOOK III: JUSTICE-REHAB (THE CODEX)

## 3.1 Restorative Cybernetics
Crime is treated as a system error or resource lack, not moral failure.
- **No Prison:** We use "Restitution" (Working off the debt) and "Social Repair".
- **The 27 Invariants:** A set of hard-coded laws protecting the individual.

### Selected Laws (The Shield)
* **§1 Physical Integrity:** Absolute ban on non-consensual force.
* **§10 Resource Sovereignty:** Food/Water/Shelter are decoupled from work status.
* **§20 Data Sovereignty:** "Your Keys, Your Data". Right to digital oblivion.
* **§22 Algorithmic Transparency:** No black-box AI decisions allowed.

# BOOK IV: SIMULATION (SOCIETY)

## 4.1 Pedagogy of Inefficiency
Learning is optimized for depth, not speed.
- **Concept:** We allow children (and adults) to "waste time" exploring, because efficiency kills creativity.
- **Goal:** Resilient generalists, not specialized biological robots.

## 4.2 The "Submarine" Strategy
How to deploy LOVALIS in a hostile world:
1. **Camouflage:** Operate legally as a Co-op or NGO.
2. **Autonomy:** Build a local Micro-Grid (Energy Independence).
3. **Infiltration:** Attract users via higher Quality of Life (V-Score).

# BOOK VII: TOOLBOX (INTERFACES)

## 7.1 Node One (Hardware)
A personal server for every citizen.
- **Dual Vault:** Physically separated storage for Private Data (Bio) and Public Data (Voting).
- **Mesh Network:** Works even if the global internet collapses.

## 7.2 V-Gate (Mental Firewall)
An NLP-filter that strips toxic emotional manipulation from incoming messages.

## 7.3 Liquid Feedback (Governance)
A dynamic voting system where you can delegate your vote to experts for specific topics, but reclaim it instantly.

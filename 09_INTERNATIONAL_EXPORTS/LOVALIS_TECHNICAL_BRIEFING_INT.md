# LOVALIS 3.7.4
## Post-National Civilization Operating System
**Status:** Gold Master | **Language:** English

---

# 1. THE PROBLEM: ENTROPY
- **Economic:** Infinite growth in finite systems = Collapse.
- **Social:** Competition destroys mental health (Cortisol spikes).
- **Political:** Short-term election cycles prevent long-term solutions.

---

# 2. THE SOLUTION: AXIOMATIC LOGIC
**The Primary Axiom:**
> "Legitimacy is defined solely by the minimization of suffering while maintaining critical sovereignty."

---

# 3. ARCHITECTURE: THE T.E.E. FILTER
No decision passes unless valid in 3 dimensions:

- **T (Technology):** Is it physically possible?
- **E (Ecology):** Is it regenerative?
- **E (Ethics):** Does it reduce suffering?

# 4. STRUCTURE: THE 12 ANCHORS
Fractal Competence instead of Hierarchy.

# 5. ECONOMY: PULSE-OS
**The Energy Standard**
- **Layer 0:** kWh (Energy Generation).
- **Layer 1:** Pulse Token (1 Pulse ~ 1 kWh).
- **Layer 2:** Spherical Compensation (Reward for Impact).

> "You cannot print value. You must generate it."

---

# 6. JUSTICE: REHAB & RESTITUTION
- **Concept:** Zero Punishment.
- **Action:** Debugging social friction.
- **Tool:** The Conflict Solver (Algorithm).

---

# 7. HARDWARE: NODE ONE
**The Sovereign Server**
- **CPU:** RISC-V (Open Source).
- **Storage:** Dual-Vault (Private/Public).
- **Network:** LoRaWAN Mesh + Starlink.

---

# 8. DEPLOYMENT: SUBMARINE MODE
We do not fight the old system.
1. **Hide:** Use Legal Wrappers (Co-ops).
2. **Build:** Energy Autonomy.
3. **Switch:** Internal Economy runs on Pulse.
